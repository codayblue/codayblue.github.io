      <description>Trueblue project Good day internet! So I am going to tell you a story about my NAS (Network Attached Storage) project. I have named the NAS Trueblue. Mostly because I am known as codayblue on the internet My wife is Stephiy Blue for a lot of things as well, so Trueblue seems to fit the family tech naming. Any way I am getting off topic as I some times do (Wife would probably say most of the time).</description>

      <description>So one morning I woke up and went on to the internet and was looking at prices for cloud computing for a project I was getting ready start. Cloud computing has gotten super cheap over the years and it has made the power of a data center available to so many people. Then I got to thinking, what would it take for me to build a cloud in my home. Crazy I know.</description>
