      <description>This year I changed a lot and I have noticed it. Like when I was a teen I learned to program because I wanted to be a hacker like from the movies. Well turns out a life of crime, it looking nothing like the movies, and also not having anything to do with hacking turned me away from criminal part. Although knowing how to program does not make someone a tinker either.</description>

      <description>Network Segmentation Hello everyone,

      <description>Trueblue project Good day internet! So I am going to tell you a story about my NAS (Network Attached Storage) project. I have named the NAS Trueblue. Mostly because I am known as codayblue on the internet My wife is Stephiy Blue for a lot of things as well, so Trueblue seems to fit the family tech naming. Any way I am getting off topic as I some times do (Wife would probably say most of the time).</description>

      <description>So one morning I woke up and went on to the internet and was looking at prices for cloud computing for a project I was getting ready start. Cloud computing has gotten super cheap over the years and it has made the power of a data center available to so many people.
